# Reducing R.I.S.C.

**R**estaurant **I**nduced **S**ubstitution due to **C**aution (**RISC**) is a Champagne Problem in the eyes of many. But for establishments that emphasize the value of their quality offerings, guest uncertainty can make these businesses victims of their own success. Even high-value items present a prospective diner with stress when they perceive the stakes of their order as above average. This can lead to fatigue during collaborative planning, with an alternative restaurant being selected to avoid the prospect of a poor menu choice.

    <b>Can machine learning reduce this sententia churn through a personalized reduction in the perceived order risk for each patron?</b>
</p>

Sententia churn is defined as the loss of a potential customer during their decision making process. It's a sort of thought attrition, occurring before they even become a customer. These would-be patrons are difficult for most businesses to identify, but a well-known brand has an advantage in this regard.

To prove this concept, the famous Death & Co. brand has offered their award-winning cocktail book, *Cocktail Codex*. Data from the book will be used to maximize the guest's ordering confidence. Some establishments accept 'returns' if a guest doesn't like their order, offering a replacement item for free. Others, like Grabowski's, omit descriptions from their menu so a guest is more likely to solicit advice from the staff. Each method requires the guest to commit time and money first; this proof of concept aims to increase ordering confidence whether the guest is four-deep at the bar or at home weighing their options.
